- [] Lease period: <!-- check the slot duration of Auction schedule, check it from https://kusama.network/auctions/ and https://polkadot.network/auctions/ -->
- [] Cap: <!-- what's your crowdloan cap balance on relaychain when creating crowdloan? -->
- [] EndBlock <!-- what's your endblock on relaychain when creating crowdloan? -->
